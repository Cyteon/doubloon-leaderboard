# Doubloon Leaderboard
> Uses actual data, but is opt-in

Not much to type here, this is just a nice little leaderboard of the people with the most doubloons. \
To opt-in/out of the leaderboard, find the leaderboard section under the weeks top projects at [The Signpost](https://highseas.hackclub.com/signpost)

# How does it work?

The leaderboard uses opted-in people's rank, which means it can only calculate ranking based on that \
There are two sorting modes, current doubloons, and all-time doubloons (all doubloons u have ever earned) \
You can also search for users, and they will appear if they are opted into the leaderboard \
